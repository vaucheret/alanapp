%%% THE BELOW IS DONE FOR CHAPTER 10 HOMEWORK #5
%%% This logic will work for converting any record to Map

%% This should be called like follows:
%% map_to_record(#nnote{}, record_info(fields, nnote), Map).
%% There are other ways to make this record that might be easier, but this is
%% a pretty future-proof implementation

%% All of this is unnecessary if you're using dynarec: https://github.com/dieswaytoofast/dynarec
map_to_record(EmptyRecord, FieldList, Map) ->

    %% NumberedFields is effectively a proplist to look up field name and get the field number
    NumberedFields = number_fields(FieldList),

    %% Converts the map to a proplist so we can easily iterate over the items
    MapList = maps:to_list(Map),

    %% Now we're going to iterate overall fields in the map
    lists:foldl(fun({Field, Value}, Record) ->

        %% Is the field is an actual field in the record
        case lists:member(Field, FieldList) of
            false ->
                %% If not, just skip it and move onto the next
                Record;
            true ->
                %% Get the field number
                FieldNum = proplists:get_value(Field, NumberedFields),
                %% and set the value in the record.
                %% We set it to FieldNum+1 because if you recall, the first element in a record tuple
                %% is the name of the tuple.
                setelement(FieldNum+1, Record, Value)
        end
    end, EmptyRecord, MapList).


%% Just like map_to_record, this should be called as follows:
%% record_to_map(NNoteRecord, record_info(fields, nnote)).
record_to_map(Record, FieldList) ->
    %% Proplistify the numbered fields
    NumberedFields = number_fields(FieldList),

    %% This time we iterate over the numbered fields
    lists:foldl(fun({Field, FieldNum}, Map) ->
        %% Get the value from the record
        Value = element(FieldNum+1, Record),

        %% Put the value into the properly named field in the map
        maps:put(Field, Value, Map)
    end, #{}, NumberedFields).


%% Converts a list of fields to numbered fields:
%% For example:
%% > numbered_fields([a,b,c])
%% [{a,1}, {b,2}, {c,3}].
number_fields(FieldList) ->
    lists:zip(FieldList, lists:seq(1, length(FieldList))).
